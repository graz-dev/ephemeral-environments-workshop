This repository contains the materials and slides for the **Ephemeral Environments Workshop**. The workshop is focused on demonstrating how to create, manage, and optimize cloud-native ephemeral environments using Kubernetes, Crossplane, CloudNativePG, and kube-green.

## Workshop Topics

- Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Installing and configuring Crossplane
- Managing cloud-native PostgreSQL clusters with [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/)
- Automating resource management and sustainability with [kube-green](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green)
- Best practices for ephemeral environments in development and testing

## Workshop Cases

- **Cloud Native PG PSQL Cluster**: Learn how to manage the shutdown and restart of a PostgreSQL cluster using the [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) operator orchestrated by Crossplane. Access the case on the [workshop slides](https://graz-dev.github.io/ephemeral-environments-workshop/#/9) or access the markdown guide in the `cases/cloud-native-pg/WORKSHOP.md` file.
